#  public/

stores files which are imported by other files in `src/` but also need to be copied to the `public/` directory at compile time

**NOTE:** the node documentation files are separated from the main translation file due to them following a different format, which allows the node translations to be made/read in a simpler way than using the standard Vue i18n format
